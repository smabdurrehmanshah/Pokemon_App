<h1>ðŸŽ’ PokÃ©mon App in React</h1>

<p>
I just completed my <strong>PokÃ©mon App in React</strong>, and it was a nostalgic yet challenging project!  
In this app, you can explore all your favorite PokÃ©mon characters in one place â€” straight from the official PokÃ©mon API.
</p>

<h3>ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fetching and working with APIs (PokÃ©mon API)</li>
  <li>Understanding and handling complex API structures</li>
  <li>Combining <code>useEffect</code> with <code>fetch</code> and <code>async/await</code></li>
  <li>Handling multiple API requests efficiently</li>
  <li>Implementing search functionality for instant results</li>
  <li>Managing loading and error states effectively</li>
</ul>

<p>
This project might seem small, but it packed a <strong>huge amount of learning</strong>.  
Sometimes, itâ€™s the small projects that help you grow the most as a developer.
